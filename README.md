## Installation

To set up the Medical Diagnosis Assistant, follow these detailed steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lakshitaa4/Diagnostic-Assistant.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Diagnostic-Assistant
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        env\Scripts\activate
        ```

5.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6.  **Configure API Key:**

    *   Obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).
    *   Edit the `Diag_Assist.py` file and replace the placeholder API key ( `"your-API-KEY"`) with your actual Gemini API key.

7.  **Install and Configure Poppler (Required for PDF to Image Conversion):**

    *   This project uses the `pdf2image` library to convert PDF pages into images, enabling the analysis of PDF reports. Follow these instructions to set up Poppler, a prerequisite for `pdf2image`:
    *   **Download and Setup Guide Follow these instructions from [pdf2image's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image).: The first key instruction is Downloading the correct version of the files. The steps for download are in the GitHub, as mentioned before. Then, for each operating system there are steps to follow, so please do that!
    *   Locate and copy the "bin" folder path, like `C:\Users\your_username\Downloads\poppler-xx.xx.x\bin`, this is just an example
    *   Then Navigate to bin folder, and copy address
    *   **PATH Set-Up**:The next key part is adding to your system's PATH. Hereâ€™s how:
        1.  Open the "System" control panel (search for "System" in the Start Menu).
        2.  Click "Advanced system settings".
        3.  Click "Environment Variables...".
        4.  In the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and click "Edit...".
        5.  Click "New" and add the path to the Poppler's `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\Poppler\poppler-xx.xx.x\bin`).
        6.  Click "OK" to save the changes.
        7.  **Restart your computer** for the changes to take effect. **Important**: Follow the specific instructions for your operating system, especially on Windows, and add the `bin` folder to the `PATH` to easily allow PDF files to be used on Medical-Diagnosis-Assistant. 
8.  **Install and Configure wkhtmltopdf (Required for PDF Report Generation):**

    * To enable the generation of PDF reports summarizing the analysis, follow these steps to install and configure `wkhtmltopdf`:
        *   **Download from official website:** Download and install wkhtmltopdf version 0.12.6 (recommended for compatibility) from the official website: [https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html). Select the installer that corresponds to your specific operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and system architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).
        Then do the `bin` address setup in PATH as you did for `pdf2image`.
*   **Path Addition**: It is similarly required to the PATH of your system, as PDF2image needs to do. To set it up properly, please follow the steps and do exactly as is said! Ensure that the system architecture is correct to have this step fully function.
